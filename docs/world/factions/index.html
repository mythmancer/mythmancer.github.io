<i>“No map can accurately represent the Wilds and so we write: Here There Be Dragons.”</i>

The Wilds are the natural state of the world -> changing landscapes, dangerous creatures and pure chaotic beauty. An adventurer venturing deep into the Wilds could walk the same way two days in a row and one day end up in a beautiful forest and the next day end up in Hell. People have always created pockets of civilization however and areas that are marched over and over again, areas that are mapped and considered a place, areas that are believed to be “home” become stable and fixed points. The farther one gets away from a fixed point the “wilder” the Wilds become.

Imperial citizens grow up on terrifying tales of the Wilds and many of them are true to a degree, but people do not realize that the Wilds are everywhere -> below the ground in labyrinthian catacombs, up in the sky in floating castles and yes, outside the borders of the Empire. The battle against the Wilds is never-ending and many religions believe that one day the Wilds will simply reclaim the entire world.

<h1>The Empire</h1>
“And Lo!” Said the Saint Tara “For I have seen the chaos and suffering of the Wilds and yet I have seen Man strive to settle it nonetheless. And so I declare- there will be an Empire from start to end of this world, mapped and ordered, safe and free such that no child will suffer to know the deprivations of what has been...” - Founding myth of the Empire

“And what did the Empire do? March in and destroy our city all in the name of order, then abandon it once again to the depravities of illusionists. Order they say? We were plenty orderly on our own.” - Mirror City oral history

The founding myth of the Empire goes something like this: Once, there was nothing but the Wilds and pockets of civilization. In one of these pockets (what would eventually become the capital of the Empire) gathered the seven Saints. They saw the chaos our world lived in and knew their cause- to establish an Empire of order, to link every piece of civilization to each other, to wipe out every last trace of the Wilds. People saw their burning cause and flocked to them. Together, the seven Saints created a new civilization like none before, sealed with righteousness and purpose -> the Empire.

The reality of the Empire... well it may be a little different.

The Empire is a theocracy ruled by the religion of the Seven Saints, managed by a council of the heads of the religious orders and many many bureaucrats. At this point the Empire is more a loose collection of territories bound by a common religious and cultural touchstone + a nominal government.

All player characters born in the Empire are considered Imperial Citizens. As Imperial Citizens they gain a Spear Proficiency (the better to be conscripted), the right to be tried under the Empire’s laws (including the conscript laws) and the right to be conscripted at random by the Imperial military. Still, life in the Empire is often considered much better than attempting to make it on your own in the Wilds. The citizens of the Empire are primarily Humans and Orcs.
