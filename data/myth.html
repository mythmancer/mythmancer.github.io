            <div class="contents-item">The Wilds</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">&ldquo;No map can accurately represent the Wilds and so we write: Here There Be Dragons.&rdquo;</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Wilds are the natural state of the world -&gt; changing landscapes, dangerous creatures and pure chaotic beauty. An adventurer venturing deep into the Wilds could walk the same way two days in a row and one day end up in a beautiful forest and the next day end up in Hell. People have always created pockets of civilization however and areas that are marched over and over again, areas that are mapped and considered a place, areas that are believed to be &ldquo;home&rdquo; become stable and fixed points. The farther one gets away from a fixed point the &ldquo;wilder&rdquo; the Wilds become.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Imperial citizens grow up on terrifying tales of the Wilds and many of them are true to a degree, but people do not realize that the Wilds are everywhere -&gt; below the ground in labyrinthian catacombs, up in the sky in floating castles and yes, outside the borders of the Empire. The battle against the Wilds is never-ending and many religions believe that one day the Wilds will simply reclaim the entire world.</div>
            <div class="contents-item">The Empire</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">&ldquo;And Lo!&rdquo; Said the Saint Tara &ldquo;For I have seen the chaos and suffering of the Wilds and yet I have seen Man strive to settle it nonetheless. And so I declare- there will be an Empire from start to end of this world, mapped and ordered, safe and free such that no child will suffer to know the deprivations of what has been...&rdquo; - Founding myth of the Empire</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">&ldquo;And what did the Empire do? March in and destroy our city all in the name of order, then abandon it once again to the depravities of illusionists. Order they say? We were plenty orderly on our own.&rdquo; - Mirror City oral history</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The founding myth of the Empire goes something like this: Once, there was nothing but the Wilds and pockets of civilization. In one of these pockets (what would eventually become the capital of the Empire) gathered the seven Saints. They saw the chaos our world lived in and knew their cause- to establish an Empire of order, to link every piece of civilization to each other, to wipe out every last trace of the Wilds. People saw their burning cause and flocked to them. Together, the seven Saints created a new civilization like none before, sealed with righteousness and purpose -&gt; the Empire.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The reality of the Empire... well it may be a little different.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Empire is a theocracy ruled by the religion of the Seven Saints, managed by a council of the heads of the religious orders and many many&nbsp;bureaucrats. At this point the Empire is more a loose collection of territories bound by a common religious and cultural touchstone + a nominal government. </div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">All player characters born in the Empire are considered Imperial Citizens. As Imperial Citizens they gain a Spear Proficiency (the better to be conscripted), the right to be tried under the Empire&rsquo;s laws (including the conscript laws) and the right to be conscripted at random by the Imperial military. Still, life in the Empire is often considered much better than attempting to make it on your own in the Wilds. The citizens of the Empire are primarily Humans and Orcs.</div>
            <h2 class="c2" id="h.cj552s1qcdib">The Seven Saints + Their Religious Orders</h2>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Seven Saints are the main figures of the religion of the Empire. They were (supposedly) important figures in the founding of the Empire and their various religious orders run the theocracy. &nbsp;</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.98hjn218va2e">Kali (Saint of War)</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Kali was initially an orcish war leader in the Orcish Isles. From a young age she had a reputation as a fierce fighter and Orcish oral history attributes many achievements to her (such as strangling a snake at a few days old in her cradle). During the initial conquest period of the Empire, Kali successfully conquered and united the Orcish Isles under her and fought the Empire to a standstill despite overwhelming odds. According to religious history, Tara then chose to personally speak to her and three days later they both emerged -&gt; the Orcish Isles a proud part of the Empire and Kali the Empire&rsquo;s foremost general.</div>
            <h4 class="c6" id="h.ep1putdf81df">Kali&rsquo;s Legion</h4>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Kali&rsquo;s Legion is the professional arm of the Imperial military, composed mostly of heavy infantry with halberd, polearm and shield specializations. Military conscripts who show talent during initial training will often be handed over to the Legion and many choose to sign on to the Legion for a term of service after their conscription period has ended. Members of the Legion are expected to strictly adhere to military hierarchy and laws. At a high enough level of training (and DM discretion) a player may become a Marked Legionnaire, tattooing the symbol of the Legion above their right eye. Many fighters choose this path, though it comes with obligations of terms of service, as the Legion provides training and other benefits. Kali&rsquo;s Legion also contains War Priests, who are Fighter/Warlock multi classers with Kali as their patron.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The elite of the Legion are the Centurions, the 100 most powerful fighters and generals of the Legion. There is only one way to become a Centurion and that is to challenge and defeat a current Centurion, taking their place. Centurions are blessed by Kali and their blessings are maintained by expensive and elaborate weekly rituals and castings of the War Priests.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.cye1sze47u73">Tara (Saint of Law)</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Little is known about Tara&rsquo;s early history and Church writings on it are vague but the popular oral tradition holds that Tara was the first of the Saints to swear to the cause. She fully held to the ideals of the Empire and was the first one to map the eventual Empire. Supposedly when she spoke, she believed in her words so strongly that the world bent itself to rearrange itself to the new truth she laid out. While she led the initial military expansion, Tara mainly spent her time enforcing the laws of the Empire, mapping its interior as it expanded and acting as the Empire&rsquo;s foremost diplomat. She founded the first Knightly Order (the Trackers) that still exists to this day.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">There are ten Knightly Orders of Tara, each headed by a Justice who is blessed by Tara. Each Justice is fully aligned to a specific ideal and members of each order must also align to those ideals to be members. Some Justices are able to bless higher level members of their Order and some just have blessings applied to themselves. Player characters may choose to join an Order if judged qualified by the DM.</div>
            <h4 class="c6" id="h.4lu807fvxsl8">Knightly Order: The Trackers</h4>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Trackers are the initial Knightly Order. They are headed by Justice Carter (who has the title Head Cartographer of the Empire) and his ideal is to map the entire world until there are no more Wilds remaining. Prospective and full members of this Order will be required to follow this ideal by recording and mapping their adventures and travels. Trackers focus their skills primarily in the Plains and commonly use horses. This order offers special training in cartography, tracking and pathfinding while in the plains, and mounted combat. A Tracker might be primarily built as a Fighter with just a small splash of Rogue.</div>
            <h4 class="c6" id="h.lyoi7yj2zfzc">Knightly Order: The Mage Mashers</h4>
            <div class="contents-subitem">In the Empire no mages are permitted to learn or use 4th level spells or higher and the enforcement of this law is (enthusiastically) handled by the Mage Mashers. The Mage Mashers (they have a more formal name but prefer the nickname) are led by Justice &ldquo;Monty&rdquo; Montgomery whose ideal is to control and contain all magic. Prospective and full members of this Order follow this ideal by viewing all magic and mages with distrust and swearing to destroy all mages who break the law. Ironically, full members of this Order actually have to have a single level in Mage so as to learn the spell Read Magic to properly identify magic texts and expedite their book burning.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Mage Mashers have had a recent upswing in popularity due to the public defeat of the dreaded Flamemaster (a high level pyromaniac mage who successfully burned down multiple cities) by Justices Montgomery and Guy.</div>
            <h4 class="c6" id="h.prsk9z5ei57y">Knightly Order: The Fire Breakers</h4>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Fire Breakers hold a simple ideal: to protect the citizens of the Empire (nay the world!) from the ravages of fire, whether that be house, city or forest fires. The order is led by Justice Guy, a former Centurion. Guy, a hairless (all the hair was long burned away) four-armed (the better to hold more buckets) orc is currently very popular after his participation in the defeat of Flamemaster in which he took several fireballs directly to the chest. Prospective and current Fire Breakers have many requirements to fulfill their ideal, including: never using Rogue skills that don&rsquo;t involve helping put out fires, never using fire offensively, always being in charge of managing all campfires and carrying a bucket at all times.</div>
            <h4 class="c6" id="h.8ftwdd23jdx5">Knightly Order: The Courtiers</h4>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Courtiers are a Knightly Order composed of the very rich and powerful and they charge excessive fees to be a member. They also require exclusivity in training. Due to this player characters are unlikely to be members of this Order. The Courtiers are led by Justice Carmella, whose ideal is the pursuit of noblesse oblige. This means that she does many good deeds, raising lots of money for charity and acting as a benevolent knight errant but it also means that she and her Order can be the exact stereotype of out of touch rich people. Carmella is highly classist and is one of the few Justices that gets along with the Idol. She often persuades the Idol into participating in her various charity endeavors.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.xdyqkh2ym44u">Sona (Saint of Beauty)</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Sona was born to a family of elven Diviners in the City of Umon and initially trained as a Diviner. While not much is known about exactly what happened, we know that Sona declared herself betrayed by the City of Umon and departed, traveling the world to seek out pieces of the Clockwork (remnants of the original foundations of the universe that the gnomes built their cities around) and invent illusion magic. Sona made a name for herself as a wandering adventurer, seeking acclamation and fame for her daring exploits. During the Empire&rsquo;s conflict with the Mirror City, she destroyed the Great Mirror, sealing the Empire&rsquo;s (initial) victory and joining the Saints in their great ambitions -&gt; though those who do not adhere to the religion of the Empire claim she did it to get access to even more pieces of the Clockwork.</div>
            <h4 class="c6" id="h.ey6qgmn2ngkq">The Idol</h4>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Sona does not have a religious order... or at least she officially doesn&rsquo;t have one. There are persistent rumors of a cabal of powerful movers and shakers that worship Sona and study illusion magic, but one would have to be recruited by them to find out the truth. The one public figure of Sona is the Idol. Much like the Justices and the Centurions, the Idol is blessed with the power of Sona but since they are the sole recipient they are far more individually powerful and blessed. The Idol most likely has changed many times over the years, but since they appear in many guises (though always beautiful) no one knows exactly how many Idols there have been. The Idol has a small cult of followers in the capital city and mostly remains there, participating in gladiator fights, pageants, and general occasional showboating for charity when Justice Carmella can get them to help.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.ht1vc1gdc4c4">Vash (Saint of Commerce)</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Vash was a powerful gnomish noble who resided at the ancient Temple City, now the Imperial Capital. He and Tara were the first two Saints to unite under their cause and the Imperial Conquest was initially launched from his city. Vash was the main administrator of the Empire and created much of the current legal and physical infrastructure of the Empire. Warlocks with Vash as their patron are known as clerics and must belong to the Clerical Order and follow its decrees. They have access to specific spells developed by Rath and Mida.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.4v8tpzu23dl4">Rath (Saint of Fertility)</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Rath was a halfling who initially studied under Mida, but soon split ways due to personal differences. He innovated farming and breeding techniques using his knowledge of magic and was one of first &ldquo;scientists&rdquo; of magic. Rath was responsible for the mostly peaceful assimilation of forest elf settlements into the Empire as he spent a significant amount of time in their major settlements. Warlocks with Rath as their patron are known as clerics and must belong to the Clerical Order and follow its decrees. They have access to specific spells developed by Rath and Mida.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.sn41w7p8cpa7">Mida (Saint of Death)</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Mida is possibly the most revered of the Saints. She is commonly depicted as a beautiful, beatific maiden, haloed in soft light, dispensing healing upon the common people. The truth about Mida is a little more unsavory.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Mida was a powerful magic user who lived in Temple City at the beginning of the Empire. Joining with the Empire gave her access to unlimited resources... and she used them to push the boundaries of spell creation more than they ever had been... and perhaps more than they ever should have been. Only very high level clerics of Mida who have sworn the Midian Oath know the true depths of what Mida did and the price she paid happily to discover almost all of the restorative magic used today.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Warlocks with Mida as their patron are known as clerics and must belong to the Clerical Order and follow its decrees. They have access to specific spells developed by Rath and Mida. High level clerics may be chosen to swear the Midian&nbsp;Oath and unlock the highest level spells of Mida, but beware- if you choose to go this path, you may not like what you find.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.o2anm0awpqgh">Umon (Saint of Knowledge)</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Umon has no religious order nor any warlocks. Umon may be revered as a Saint, but if you ask a high level Diviner they will tell you that the Saint Umon was simply a major leader of the City of Umon who worked with the Empire, and that the true Umon demands pursuit of knowledge not worship. Despite this, many Imperial citizens believe that the City of Umon and the Library of Umon were named after Saint Umon. </div>
            <h2 class="c2" id="h.n8w1x2l5jihb">The Imperial Capital</h2>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Long ago, far before the existence of the Empire, the Imperial Capital was one of the four great Gnomish cities. These cities were the Flying City, the Mirror City, the Temple City (now the Imperial Capital) and the Oasis City (now the City of Umon). By the time of the Empire&rsquo;s creation the gnomish civilizations (though a small population of gnomes remains) had been evicted from both the Temple City and the City of Umon. Vast catacombs lay under the Imperial Capital including under the Imperial Palace -&gt; though access to them is heavily guarded, dark and dangerous secrets lurk within them.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Rath also built a giant hydroponic garden in the first layer of the catacombs and many of his clerics still tend to it. Some of the plants are a bit carnivorous- be careful if you enter. </div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Imperial Capital is the center of the Empire and home to much of its political wheeling and dealing despite the fraying cohesion of the Empire. All the leaders of the Imperial Church reside here including Justice Carmella and the Idol. The Imperial Capital is the cultural center of the Empire and the average citizen that resides there has a much higher quality of life, as well as a higher income.</div>
            <h2 class="c2" id="h.kvydgwacbg0a">The Borderlands</h2>
            <div class="contents-subitem">On the outskirts of the Empire lie the Borderlands, part civilization and part Wilds. This is the area that is only barely tamed and this is the area in which the forest elves live in various tree cities. Brought under the Empire&rsquo;s sphere of influence by Rath the forest elves maintain an uneasy allegiance to the Empire, though some elven settlements are stoutly anti-imperial and claim to have never been conquered.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Even the friendliest forest elf settlements are aloof and often unwelcoming to visitors, but they are far more pleasant to encounter than the Wild Elves that sometimes venture out of the Wilds into the Borderlands. Wild Elves are not so much elves as they are undying vicious fey, prone to sadistic mischief and unconcerned with morals. Occasionally a forest elf will go &ldquo;wild&rdquo; and spend many years with them. Some never return to the Borderlands or civilization.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Recently one of the larger elvish settlements was taken over by the Wilds (though some anti-Imperials might prefer the term &ldquo;reclaimed&rdquo;) which has caused a lot of alarm among the Imperial troops in the area.</div>
            <h2 class="c2" id="h.ji02l8fe691o">The Orcish Isles</h2>
            <div class="contents-subitem">One of the early conquests of the Empire, the Orcish Isles are the original home of Kali and Kali&rsquo;s Legion. The orcs there (though not just orcs live there) are proud seamen and many go on to become privateers (aka pirates, but sanctioned by the Empire). Pre-Empire they spent most of their time feuding with each other. Now, with the help of the Empire they instead spend most of their time subjecting other places, whether that be via Kali&rsquo;s Legion (of which the Orcish Isles provides the most members) or through more personal adventuring.</div>
            <div class="contents-item">City of Umon</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Deep in the desert lies the City of Umon, home of the desert elves. It is almost impossible to find the city without the assistance of a member of the Pathfinder&rsquo;s Guild who jealously guard their pathfinding magic. The City of Umon is a theocracy of sorts -&gt; it is ruled by the Priests of Umon, also known as Diviners, who worship the pursuit of knowledge (and the hoarding of it) as declared by Umon. Umon the entity (who is not Saint Umon despite having the same name) does not reward worshippers. In fact, Umon is more of a concept, a piece of the world before with unknowable power and no way to be comprehended by mortals though that doesn&rsquo;t stop them from trying. The center of the City of Umon is Umon&rsquo;s Library (also not named after Saint Umon. The name Umon is the most popular name in the City of Umon which causes much confusion among those who do not reside there).</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">At one point the City of Umon used to be the gnomish Oasis City but very few people know that. If the Priests of Umon had their way, no one would. Those in the know believe that Umon&rsquo;s Library is actually the largest piece of the Clockwork to still exist.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The City of Umon is technically allied with the Empire but has an uneasy relationship with the Empire as the Imperial Government has always made their wish to rule the City of Umon rather evident. For now, however, the two co-exist as neither can subjugate the other.</div>
            <h2 class="c2" id="h.9vrg5sjn1ieg">The Library</h2>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Umon&rsquo;s Library contains all knowledge, past, present and future, true and untrue... if you are able to find it. An ever-changing maze of rooms, full of dangerous landscapes and creatures, the Library provides untold riches and knowledge and Diviners devote their life to excavating small scraps of knowledge from it. They are aided in this journey by Index&nbsp;and Query, two strange demons obsessed with cataloging. </div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Indexers are a class of demons; there are many of them in the library. Most of them are unfriendly. They sort of resemble Kamaji from Spirited Away&nbsp;but with a big pig nose they sniff books with. They spend their time sniffing out knowledge and its location. Index is the largest and most powerful Indexer in the library.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Query is unique as far as the Diviners can tell. Query sits at a round desk and their obese slug-like body fills the volume of the round desk with tiny little glasses near where their head seems to be. Query spends their time cataloging the location of knowledge that the Indexers find and will share it for a price.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Outside of the true Library is the repository of knowledge maintained by the Diviners and for those not in the know, this is believed to be the actual Library of Uman. Pilgrims pay large amounts of money to get their questions answered from these catalogs of information.</div>
            <div class="contents-item">The Flying City</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Flying City is the last remaining Gnomish stronghold after the takeover of the Mirror City by the Master of Mirrors. As such, the gnomes of the Flying City are very wary of other people and keep the exact location of the Flying City obscured in the mountains of Hive. The Knightly Order of Trackers has attempted to map its location several times and each time, with much force of magic, the gnomes of the Flying City have activated the remaining fragment of the Clockwork and flown the city to a new location. The entire city cannot remain flying indefinitely, but certain important buildings are kept in the air permanently. They are not friendly towards the Empire but maintain decent relations with Hive.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Many hundreds of years ago the Flying City sent off a great expedition to found a new city, sacrificing a major piece of their fragment of the Clockwork to create a massive flying castle. The flying castle launched and was promptly swept up in a storm of epic proportions that had never seen before and vanished, never to be seen again... unless you happen to get lost enough in a storm and end up in a mysterious place called the Eye of the Storm.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Flying City is protected by their troop of Falconers, masterful Rouge/Fighters who train birds to scout and do various tasks. Troops approaching the Flying City will be harried and destroyed by collapsing cliffs, intricate traps and sniper archers in the night. The Falconers are sworn enemies of the Knightly Order of Trackers (and vice versa) who continue to attempt to map their location.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Gnomes are the oldest race in the world and are speculated to be part Clockwork. </div>
            <div class="contents-item">Hive</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Deep in the center of a great mountain lies Hive, the foremost city of the dwarves. But Hive is not just a city -&gt; it is the entryway to a labyrinth of mines that contain galleries and galleries of dwarfs.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Dwarfs are an unusual race -&gt; they were formed out of clay by the Craftsman and stacked in galleries. Only a dwarven queen can awaken a dwarf from clay by reading their true name out loud and once she does the dwarf is bound to her and her will, shown through the clan symbol that appears on the palm of their hands. A dwarf takes on the name of their queen and clan as their last name. Access to the galleries are strictly guarded by the Nine Queen Alliance that rules Hive. However, all is not as well as it seems. What once seemed like a never-ending surplus of galleries are getting harder and harder to find, and the dwarven miners in charge of excavating further and further below Hive are encountering more and more dangerous terrain...</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Dwarves are not the only things living under Hive. In the catacombs of hollowed out mines live the Clay Trolls. Rejects of the Craftsman, they seek to consume other trolls and dwarves for that is how they grow stronger. If a Clay Troll were to consume a queen they might just be unstoppable...</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">A queen can be awakened by any dwarf but they are very rarely found in galleries. Dwarven queens are naturally the size of Hill Giants but can shrink at will to the size of dwarves. They are innately charming to dwarves and are immensely powerful upon awakening. While dwarves do die of natural causes at ~150 years old, no queen has ever died of natural causes, though many have died of unnatural causes in the unending power struggles of Hive.</div>
            <h2 class="c2" id="h.cwhej8kl6yvt">The Nine Queen Alliance</h2>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Hive is ruled by an alliance of Nine Queens -&gt; but in reality, it is truly ruled by Queen Ironfist.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.e4erzae0g1eu">Queen Ironfist</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Queen Ironfist is the oldest living dwarven queen in existence and she may be the oldest and most powerful being in the world. Luckily she is far more concerned with controlling Hive and politically manipulating the other queens than in conquest. Queen Ironfist seeks out only the most talented dwarves to awaken as part of her clan. Player characters may only be members of the Ironfist clan with DM approval; that is to say, player characters will not be from the Ironfist clan &#x1f600;</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.q5reanuda77f">Queen Hammertoe</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Queen Hammertoe primarily seeks out warriors and miners. She was awakened at the same time as her sister queen Queen Helm&uuml;their and the two are inseparable. Queen Hammertoe initiates every new dwarf into her clan by beating them up on the training field.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.hng84n7myh74">Queen Helm&uuml;their</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Queen Helm&uuml;their primarily seeks out miners and warriors to awaken. She was awakened at the same time as her sister queen Queen Hammertoe and the two are inseparable. Queen Helm&uuml;their initiates every new dwarf into her clan by beating them up on the training field.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.xp9sdh8apj33">Queen Featherstone</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Queen Featherstone is the only living queen that was personally awakened by Queen Ironfist and due to that Queen Ironfist has a slight fondness towards her. This is good, because Featherstone is far more interested in exploring and inventing than participating in helping Hive function. Unfortunately this extends to supporting her clan members - Featherstone will awaken any dwarf allotted to her then toss them out into the world. If they make it to level 5 she may learn their name and take an interest in them. Due to this, adventurer dwarfs found outside Hive are often members of Clan Featherstone.</div>
            <h2 class="c2" id="h.iqrgfe8wjdte">The Minor Three</h2>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Minor Three are a trio of queens that maintain civil relations with the Nine Queen Alliance and are welcome in Hive but have managed to avoid being subsumed into Queen Ironfist&rsquo;s sphere of influence.</div>
            <h3 class="c4" id="h.vc3qqww1rbsj">Queen Jeweleater</h3>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Queen Jeweleater is a queen of artificers, specializing in choosing and awakening the most talented craftsdwarves. She maintains relations with both Queen Ironfist and Queen Foolsgold, balancing them carefully. She is also the main source of the mysterious rainbow shells that rumors say come from the Eye of the Storm...</div>
            <h2 class="c2" id="h.3q8jurbb7kwy">Queen Foolsgold</h2>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Queen Foolsgold&nbsp;is the second strongest dwarven queen in the Hive region -&gt; a ranking confirmed by her unsuccessful coup several centuries ago that she was exiled from Hive for. Queen Foolsgold&nbsp;and Queen Ironfist are mortal enemies and maintain an ongoing cold war that may be heating up again. Dwarves of Clan Foolsgold&nbsp;are often proficient in illusion magic which allows them to disguise their clan symbol to sneak into Hive, either to drink or to perform acts of sabotage. Adventurer dwarves are often members of Clan Foolsgold.</div>
            <div class="contents-item">The North</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">&ldquo;And then the Frost Giant appeared at the campsite and shouted &ldquo;Ho ho ho! I smell a naughty child -&gt; my favorite dessert!&rdquo; and all the naughty children screamed and tried to run away but it was too late...&rdquo; - excerpt from a fable told to Northern children</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">&ldquo;Well their city was stupid anyway. Plus it&rsquo;s way too cold up there. What sensible person wants to live there?&rdquo; - anachronistic quote attributed to Vash upon learning that the Imperial Legion had once again been repulsed from the walls of Frostpakt Fortress</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Up in the Wild mountains beyond the Empire&rsquo;s northern borders live the nomadic northern clans (composed mostly of humans and orcs); also various terrible creatures like Frost Giants, demonic even-toed ungulates, enormous ice snakes that can swallow a horse whole, etc. </div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The nomadic clans maintain only one (known) stronghold against the Wilds -&gt; a former Frost Giant castle called Frostpakt Fortress. Long ago the clans came together and evicted the previous occupants; it remains a place where all northern clan members can gather in peace and trade and interact to their heart&#39;s content though non-clan members are rarely welcome within the walls. </div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The northern clans and the Frost Giants are sworn enemies and will fight if they encounter each other.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Life in the northern Wilds is very tough and so the people that live there maintain a strong tradition of hospitality. They learn to ride sturdy mountain horses from a young age and survive well in cold and mountainous terrain. The clans mostly follow various nature or ancestral patrons and are a common target of missionaries of Kali. Many of the northern clans have a neutral relationship with the Empire, with most Imperial citizens regarding them as barbarians if they know they exist.</div>
            <div class="contents-item">The Mirror City</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Mirror City was one of the four great Gnomish strongholds, built around the Great Mirror which powered their strong illusion magic. When the Empire decided to annex the Mirror City, the gnomes living there used their piece of the Clockwork to defend, creating hordes of shadowy monsters that decimated the Imperial Legion. During this battle, Sona took advantage of the chaos to sneak into their stronghold and gain control of the Great Mirror. As she studied it, she realized that the use of it (including hers) was creating an even more dangerous evil -&gt; the Master of Mirrors. Before the Master of Mirrors could emerge she shattered the Great Mirror, allowing the Empire to take over the Mirror City, and creating thousands of doppelgangers of herself, one for each shard of the Great Mirror.</div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">Over the next few decades the doppelgangers ate each other, growing more powerful as they consumed each other. Eventually the largest shard claimed the title of the Master of Mirrors and uniting the remaining anti-Imperial sentiment, managed to sever the magical ties to the Empire and allow the city to retreat into the Wilds. </div>
            <div class="contents-subitem">The Mirror City is now a very dangerous city, full of illusions and deadly magic and ruled over by the capricious Master of Mirrors. Despite this, those who wish to study high level illusion magic will need to spend some time there. The Master of Mirrors has a complicated relationship with the followers of Sona- after all, they are a reflection of her.</div>
