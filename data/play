# Abilities

> ### Character Creation Step 1 - Assign initial Modifiers
> Assign the modifier `[+1, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1]` in any order you want across the six Abilities:
> Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and
> Charisma (CHA)

Your character is composed of six core attributes called Abilities. These are Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

Each Ability is represented by a single number called an Ability Modifier (e.g. Strength Modifier).
As your character Levels up, your Ability Modifiers will increase, making your character more
powerful over time.

# Races

> ### Character Creation Step 2 - Select a Race
> Select a Race for your character, the possible races are Telon, Kyma, Gaean, Cyclops, Dendrid, and
> Orid. Based on your selection, select and copy down the following:
> 1. Copy down any **Features** associated with your selected race
> 2. Select a **Skill** from your selected race's list of skills to receive Training in
> 3. Optionally choose one **Ability Modifier Adjustment**

There are six playable races in Mythmancer, these are Telon, Kyma, Gaean, Cyclops, Dendrid, and
Orid. All races are capable of excelling at any role within an adventuring party. Still, your choice
of race can influence a few things about your character, these are:

* **Racial Features** - your choice of race automatically confers a few attributes to your character
  regardless of any other choice you make.
* **Racial Skill** - your character will begin trained in one Skill based on their race.
* **Racial Ability Modifier Adjustment (optional)** - based on your character's race, you may choose
  a trait typical to that race that increases one Ability by 1 and decreases another by 1.

## Description of Races

---

### Telon

The Telon are a widespread group of semiaquatic humans who exhibit light builds and inhabit
communities primarily around lakes and rivers. The height of Telon can vary broadly from populations
who show average heights of 4' all the way up to 5'6", a fact seemingly associated with the size of
the body of water which they originate.

Telon-majority societies similarly vary, from simple pastoral communities to grand city states such
as the desert city of Umon.

#### Features

> ##### Natural Swimmer
> *Gain Training in the Swimming Skill, can achieve Mastery in Swimming without a requisite Skill
Mastery*
>
> Telon have proportionally long arms, hardy rotator cuffs, minimal body hair, and great lung
> capacity making them excellent swimmers.

#### Skills

> **Choose 1**: Swimming*, Stealth, Husbandry, Literacy, Medicine, Nature, Animism,
> Perception
>
> \* By choosing Swimming, Telon achieve Mastery in combination with their Natural Swimmer feature

#### Ability Modifier Adjustment (Optional)

> ##### Option 1 - Gregarious `CHA+1` `CON-1`
> The Telon are widespread in spite of their smaller size compared to other Human populations due to
> a tendency toward large collectivist family units who protect each other.

> ##### Option 2 - Instinctive `WIS+1` `INT-1`
> Telon populations along streams and inland lakes are often simple and agrarian focusing on a
> harmonious relationship with nature but feature little in the way of organized education.

> ##### Option 3 - Lithe `DEX+1` `STR-1`
> Telon are seldom clumsy and have a low center of gravity. When Telon communities field a militia,
> they tend to deploy hit-and-run skirmishers who use slings and bows as opposed to heavily armed
> infantry.

---

### Kyma

The Kyma are saltwater-dwelling cousins of the Telon, exhibiting average heights between 5' and 5'8"
and powerful, hardy builds. Kyma societies are found almost exclusively in coastal areas, with many
Kyma spending a majority of their lives at sea.

With a strong streak of infantry and naval culture, the Kyma have famously constructed and held a
number of strongholds against impossible odds under years of grueling siege.

#### Features

> ##### Feature - Tough
> *Increase Max Wound Points by 1*
>
> Kyma have thick skin, strong bones, and even the ability to develop blubber, making them
> notably very difficult to kill.

#### Skills

> **Choose 1**: Athletics, Swimming, Locks and Traps, Appraisal, History, Tactics, Influence

#### Ability Modifier Adjustment (Optional)

> ##### Option 1 - Bulky `STR+1` `DEX-1`
> Kyma are often very well-muscled, which fits their seafaring lifestyles. They are also often quite
> heavy and have thick fingers and hands, making delicate tasks a bit more difficult.

> ##### Option 2 - Absorbed `INT+1` `WIS-1`
> Kyma societies have succeeded on their ability to aggregate knowledge from their many ports,
> honing their construction techniques especially in shipbuilding. Kyma often have a lot of time to
> their thoughts thanks to long months at sea giving them time to study many things.

> ##### Option 3 - Stubborn `CON+1` `CHA-1`
> Kyma are often immovable both physically and socially. Many prominent Kyma figures have elevated
> spite to an art form, and they are even difficult to ply with alcohol thanks to higher than
> average tolerance.

### Gaean

Gaeans are a widespread race of tall plains-dwelling humans. They are said to have descended from
the "least of giants" and many possess the sturdiness of their fore bearers. Gaeans are very
intelligent and gregarious, forming societies that span multiple cities.

Throughout history, the few empires that have formed were composed of significant gaean majorities.

#### Features

> ##### Natural Athlete
> *Gain Training in the Athletics Skill, can achieve Mastery in Athletics without a requisite Skill
> Mastery*
>
> Gaeans have a long-standing culture of cities competing with each other in athletic events,
> fostering friendly rivalries and connecting neighbors.

#### Skills

> **Choose 1**: Athletics*, Husbandry, History, Medicine, Tactics, Tracking, Influence, Performance
>
> \* By choosing Athletics, Gaeans achieve Mastery in combination with their Natural Athlete feature

#### Ability Modifier Adjustment (Optional)

> ##### Option 1 - Amicable `CHA+1` `WIS-1`
> Gaeans are generally easy to get along with, and are good team players. They can tend to be a bit
> gullible however, and are the most likely group of humans to form cults and blindly prop up
> despots.

> ##### Option 2 - Bookish `INT+1` `STR-1`
> Gaean don't necessarily exhibit the sheer might of their gigantic progenitors, but they make up
> for it in ingenuity. Education is actually somewhat common among Gaean cities with nearly double
> the average literacy rates of other groups of humans.

> ##### Option 3 - Hefty `CON+1` `DEX-1`
> Gaeans do tend to exhibit similar sturdiness to their giant ancestors, but their height also
> often makes them top-heavy and comparatively clumsy.

---

### Cyclops

Cyclopes, or more accurately Lesser Cyclopes are one-eyed relatives of the Gaeans. Similarly
descended from giants, Cyclopes are taller and stronger than other humans with heights of 7' being
rare but not unheard of. While a significantly diminutive form of the original Cyclopes, they live
up to their namesake through long traditions of craftsmanship, husbandry, and combat.

Cyclopes are uncommon and relatively long-lived, some growing as old as 200 years. They are found
wherever Gaeans are found, living fairly old-fashioned lifestyles.

#### Features

> ##### Evil Eye
> *Learn Evil Eye as a 1st Degree Spell, gain one additional 1st Degree Spell Point*
>
> Cyclopes are well-known for their ability to inflict bad luck on anyone who earns their ire with
> a piercing glare, a gift they retain from their fore bearers.

#### Skills

> **Choose 1**: Appraisal, Husbandry, Nature, Animism, Perception, Tracking, Influence, Performance

#### Ability Modifier Adjustment (Optional)

> ##### Option 1 - Brutish `STR+1` `INT-1`
> Cyclopes are massive, nearly twice the weight of other humans, and are correspondingly physically
> powerful. Some groups of Cyclopes see little need to participate in the organized education of
> Gaeans as there is always a niche for their great strength.

> ##### Option 2 - Hefty `CON+1` `DEX-1`
> Cyclopes do tend to exhibit similar sturdiness to their giant ancestors, but their height also
> often makes them top-heavy and comparatively clumsy.

> ##### Option 3 - Reserved `WIS+1` `CHA-1`
> Cyclopes are long-lived giving them more experience on average to call upon for insight, but also
> sometimes insular, set in their ways, and inflexible. Some tend to avoid forging deep friendships
> with non-cyclopes due to the major difference in lifespan making cyclopes seem standoffish.

### Dendrid

The Dendroi are humanoid tree-folk. They can be quite short and quite tall, as little as 4' and as
much as 8' if standing fully up-right, but are nearly universally slim and spindly, like a sapling.
This is because Dendroi are saplings, sprouted from the seeds of Dryad-inhabited trees that have
been sown by Satyrs. Dendroi live their lives across 70-year "seasons" in which they gradually
metamorphose between appearing more sapling-like and more satyr/nymph-like, beginning and ending
the season in tree form. Their memories don't persist well between seasons so when they emerge,
a given dendrid might have a completely different personality.

Dendroi are found in most large forests and usually build their settlements near and around the
stumps of gargantuan "elder trees" leftover from a previous era.

#### Features

> ##### Elemental Alignment - Wood
> Dendroi always have at least Wood Alignment I, which grants affinity to Water-aligned things and
> antipathy to Metal-aligned things.

> ##### Plant Biology
> Dendroi are plants and thus have a very different biology from humans. Some results of this are:
> * **Ordinary Poison and Disease Immunity** - dendroi are unaffected by most poisons and diseases
    affecting humans. Dendroi have normal vulnerability to plant poisons and diseases.
> * **Aging Immunity** - dendroi are not harmed from aging effects due to their tree-scale
    lifespans
> * **Plant Medicine** - Husbandry is used in place of Medicine when treating wounds and diseases in
    dendroi

> ##### Regeneration via Hibernation and Cloning
> A dendrid can go into hibernation, which after one month they fully metamorphose, becoming
> indistinguishable from a tree. After 11 months, the dendrid returns with the following affects:
> * Lose 1 Level of Experience
> * **Regenerate** - fully regenerate from all grievous injuries
> * **Randomize Class** - class is potentially partially randomized. Referring to the Class Wheel,
    change to a class corresponding to the following results on 2d6: [2-3] = 2 Steps CCW, [4-5] - 1
    Step CCW, [6-8] - No Change, [9-10] - 1 Step CW, [11-12] - 2 Steps CW
> * **Randomize Ability Modifier Adjustment** - randomly select a new Ability Modifier Adjustment
>
> A dendrid can also clone themselves by planting a limb. The clone is complete after 1 year,
> arriving with the same randomization as hibernation, but loses half the original's levels as
> opposed to just 1.
>
> A dendrid can only hibernate once and can only clone once per 70 years.

#### Skills

> **Choose 1**: Stealth, History, Medicine, Nature, Animism, Tracking, Performance

#### Ability Modifier Adjustment (Optional)

> ##### Option 1 - Delicate `CHA+1` `STR-1`
> Dendroi often exhibit a glamor of beauty and a tendency toward festivity befitting their Dryad and
> Satyr "parents". As saplings though, many dendroi have narrow limbs and musculature that are not
> especially suited to explosive power, preferring gentle and steady approach to things.

> ##### Option 2 - Flighty `DEX+1` `INT-1`
> Dendroi can have incredibly steady and precise hands and usually are light-footed. Dendroi can
> hold very still in a meadow against a tree and become nearly invisible to all but the most keen
> observers. One would think these behaviors would lead to the Dendroi having much time to their
> thoughts, but Dendroi also have a tendency to think about absolutely nothing for days at a time
> much like a tree.

> ##### Option 3 - Wizened `WIS+1` `CON-1`
> Dendroi live for a very long time and often have vague recollections of many past seasons giving
> them unique perspectives on things. Old as they can be though, Dendroi are still saplings of the
> great trees they will eventually become and are thus of light and narrow stature.

### Orid

The Oroi are humanoid clay-folk. As a rule, all Oroi are exactly 5' tall and weigh 140 pounds. This
is because they are made to exacting precision by the Craftsman, their god. Long ago, a group
of Oreades (Mountain Nymphs) desired to live in the mortal world and petitioned the Craftsman to
make bodies for them to inhabit. They also asked the Craftsman to make caretakers and assistants for
them. The Craftsman agreed and thus the Orid Queens and Oroi were born. Each time a volcano erupts,
the Craftsman is firing a great kiln to bake more Oroi who will eventually be unearthed by other
Oroi.

Oroi physically resemble painted ceramic urns in humanoid shape, with a broad variety of colors,
patterns, and even decorative features like tails and horns. Oroi Queens have similar features and
are 10' tall giants, but commonly shrink themselves down to 5'1", an inch higher than their Oroi
subjects.

Generally, Oroi live on and in hills and mountains in highly organized and industrious guild-based
societies.

#### Features

> ##### Elemental Alignment - Earth
> Oroi always have at least Earth Alignment I, which grants affinity to Fire-aligned things and
> antipathy to Wood-aligned things.

> ##### Constructed Biology
> Oroi are animate clay constructs, and are thus very atypical in terms of biology:
> * **Ordinary Poison and Disease Immunity** - Oroi are completely unaffected by all animal and
    plant poisons and diseases
> * **Asphyxiation Resistance** - While Oroi can be knocked unconscious through asphyxiation, they
    can never die from it. Oroi are affected by asphyxiation at 1/4 the ordinary rate.
> * **Immutable** - Oroi cannot polymorph, shape-shift, or change size
> * **Crafted Medicine** - Appraisal is used in place of Medicine when treating wounds and diseases
    in oroi

> ##### Lack of Buoyancy
> Oroi do not float in water under natural conditions and thus cannot ever attain Training in the
> Swimming skill. Further Oroi automatically fail all Swimming checks. However, they are quite dense
> and so unlikely to be carried away by average river currents, so they might usually not need to
> pass Swimming checks to navigate some bodies of water especially given their Asphyxiation
> Resistance.

#### Skills

> **Choose 1**: Locks and Traps, Stealth, Appraisal, History, Literacy, Tactics, Perception

#### Ability Modifier Adjustment (Optional)

> ##### Option 1 - Dense `CON+1` `INT-1`
> Some Oroi are made with very thick skin, leaving less room in the head for sophisticated thoughts.

> ##### Option 2 - Fixated `DEX+1` `WIS-1`
> Many Oroi are incredibly handy, befitting a group created the Craftsman. Some Oroi are so
> hyper-focused on their craft at the detriment to their situational awareness.

> ##### Option 3 - Headstrong `STR+1` `CHA-1`
> Oroi are strong and hardworking, taking on physically arduous trades. They also have a tendency
> to mannerisms that might seem strange to non-oroi, or even oroi outside their own clan.
