# Abilities

> **Character Creation Step 1 - Assign initial Modifiers**
>
> Assign the modifiers `[+1, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1]` in any order you want across the six Abilities:
> [Strength (STR)](#strength-str), [Dexterity (DEX)](#dexterity-dex),
> [Constitution (CON)](#constitution-con), [Intelligence (INT)](#intelligence-int),
> [Wisdom (WIS)](#wisdom-wis), and [Charisma (CHA)](#charisma-cha)

Your character is composed of six core attributes called Abilities. These are Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

Each Ability is represented by a single number called an Ability Modifier (e.g. Strength Modifier).
As your character Levels up, your Ability Modifiers will increase, making your character more
powerful over time.

## Strength (STR)

Strength is your character's physical might. Strength is primarily important for Fighters or
anyone else who will participate in a lot of melee combat.

Strength affects:

* Bonus to Hit and Damage with Melee Weapons
* Bonus to Damage with Throwing Weapons
* Effectiveness of Shields (*Evasion*)
* Total Carrying Capacity
* **Skills** - Athletics, Swimming

## Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity is your character's hand-to-eye coordination and agility. Dexterity is important for
Fighters who primarily engage in ranged combat as well as Rogues who employ finesse skills.

Dexterity affects:

* Bonus to Hit with Ranged Weapons
* Reflex Save Throws - used to avoid harm from things like falls, traps, and explosions
* Effectiveness of *Evasion*
* **Skills** - Locks and Traps, and Stealth
* **Adept Skills** - Countercast

## Constitution (CON)

Constitution is your character's physical durability and endurance. Constitution is very important
for Fighters who engage in melee, but all characters can benefit greatly from a small investment
into Constitution.

Constitution affects:

* Maximum Hit Points and Wound Points
* Fortitude Save Throws - used to avoid harm from things like poison and disease
* Maximum Armor Weight
* Total Carrying Capacity
* **Adept Skills**: Concentration

## Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence is your character's mental acuity. Intelligence is important for Adepts who want to
be able to cast many different spells and Rogues who are trained in a variety of knowledge-based
Skills.

Intelligence affects:

* Maximum Spells per Degree Learnable
* Maximum Spell Complexity
* **Skills**: Appraisal, History, Husbandry, Literacy, Medicine, Nature, Tactics
* **Adept Skills**: Spellcraft

## Wisdom (WIS)

Wisdom is your character's mental resilience and perceptiveness. Wisdom is important for Adepts
who want to get the most out of simpler spells and Rogues who utilize keen senses.

Wisdom affects:

* Spell Potency and Spell Save DC of many spells
* Maximum Degree of Spells channeled from Patrons.
* Will Save Throws - used to avoid harm from things that affect the mind
* **Skills** - Animism, Perception, Tracking

## Charisma (CHA)

Charisma is your character's likeability and expressiveness. Charisma is important for any
character who wishes to play the role of a team's Face, but is also essential for any Adept who
wants to specialize in mind-affecting spells.

Charisma affects:

* Spell Potency and Spell Save DC of mind-affecting spells such as Illusions and Charms.
* **Skills** - Influence, Performance

# Races

> **Character Creation Step 2 - Select a Race**
>
> Select a race for your character. The possible races are [Telon](#telon), [Kyma](#kyma),
> [Gaean](#gaean), [Cyclops](#cyclops), [Dendrid](#dendrid), and [Orid](#orid). Based on your
> selection:
> 1. Copy down any **Features** associated with your selected race.
> 2. Select a **Skill** from your selected race's list of skills to receive Training in.
> 3. Optionally choose one **Trait** available to your selected race and adjust your Ability
     Modifiers accordingly.

## Telon

The Telon are a widespread group of semiaquatic humans who exhibit light builds and inhabit
communities primarily around lakes and rivers. The height of Telon can vary broadly from populations
who show average heights of 4' all the way up to 5'6", a fact seemingly associated with the size of
the body of water which they originate.

Telon-majority societies similarly vary, from simple pastoral communities to grand city states such
as the desert city of Umon.

### Telon Features

All Telon possess the following feature:

> **Natural Swimmer**

> them excellent swimmers.</sub>

### Telon Skills

### Telon Traits

Optionally choose one of the following Traits:

>
> <sub>The Telon are widespread in spite of their smaller size compared to other Human populations
> due to a tendency toward large collectivist family units who protect each other.</sub>

> **Instinctive** `WIS+1` `INT-1`
>
> <sub>Telon populations along streams and inland lakes are often simple and agrarian focusing on a
> harmonious relationship with nature but feature little in the way of organized education.</sub>

> **Lithe** `DEX+1` `STR-1`
>
> <sub>Telon are seldom clumsy and have a low center of gravity. When Telon communities field a
> militia, they tend to deploy hit-and-run skirmishers who use slings and bows as opposed to
> infantry.</sub>

## Kyma

The Kyma are saltwater-dwelling cousins of the Telon, exhibiting average heights between 5' and 5'8"
and powerful, hardy builds. Kyma societies are found almost exclusively in coastal areas, with many
Kyma spending a majority of their lives at sea.

With a strong streak of infantry and naval culture, the Kyma have famously constructed and held a
number of strongholds against impossible odds under years of grueling siege.

### Kyma Features

All Kyma possess the following feature:

> **Tough**
>
> Increase Max Wound Points by 1.

> honing their construction techniques especially in shipbuilding. Kyma often have a lot of time to
> their thoughts thanks to long months at sea giving them time to study many things.</sub>

> **Stubborn** `CON+1` `CHA-1`
>
> <sub>Kyma are often immovable both physically and socially. Many prominent Kyma figures have
> elevated spite to an art form, and they are even difficult to ply with alcohol thanks to higher
> than average tolerance.</sub>

## Gaean

Gaeans are a widespread race of tall plains-dwelling humans. They are said to have descended from
the "least of giants" and many possess the sturdiness of their forbearers. Gaeans are very
intelligent and gregarious, forming societies that span multiple cities.

Throughout history, the few empires that have formed were composed of significant gaean majorities.

### Gaean Features

All Gaeans possess the following feature:

> **Natural Athlete**
>
> Gain Training in the Athletics Skill, can achieve Mastery in Athletics without a requisite Skill

> despots.</sub>

>
> <sub>Gaean don't necessarily exhibit the sheer might of their gigantic progenitors, but they make
> up for it in ingenuity. Education is actually somewhat common among Gaean cities with nearly
> double the average literacy rates of other groups of humans.</sub>

> **Hefty** `CON+1` `DEX-1`
>
> <sub>Gaeans do tend to exhibit similar sturdiness to their giant ancestors, but their height also
> often makes them top-heavy and comparatively clumsy.</sub>

## Cyclops

Cyclopes, or more accurately Lesser Cyclopes are one-eyed relatives of the Gaeans. Similarly
descended from giants, Cyclopes are taller and stronger than other humans with heights of 7' being
rare but not unheard of. While a significantly diminutive form of the original Cyclopes, they live
up to their namesake through long traditions of craftsmanship, husbandry, and combat.

Cyclopes are uncommon and relatively long-lived, some growing as old as 200 years. They are found
wherever Gaeans are found, living fairly old-fashioned lifestyles.

### Cyclops Features

All Cyclopes possess the following feature:

> **Evil Eye**
>
> Learn Evil Eye as a 1st Degree Spell, gain one additional 1st Degree Spell Point.

> education of Gaeans as there is always a niche for their great strength.</sub>

> **Hefty** `CON+1` `DEX-1`
>
> <sub>Cyclopes do tend to exhibit similar sturdiness to their giant ancestors, but their height
> also often makes them top-heavy and comparatively clumsy.</sub>

> **Reserved** `WIS+1` `CHA-1`
>
> <sub>Cyclopes are long-lived giving them more experience on average to call upon for insight, but
> also sometimes insular, set in their ways, and inflexible. Some tend to avoid forging deep
> friendships with non-cyclopes due to the major difference in lifespan making cyclopes seem
> standoffish.</sub>

## Dendrid

The Dendroi are humanoid tree-folk. They can be quite short and quite tall, as little as 4' and as
much as 8' if standing fully up-right, but are nearly universally slim and spindly, like a sapling.
This is because Dendroi are saplings, sprouted from the seeds of Dryad-inhabited trees that have
been sown by Satyrs. Dendroi live their lives across 70-year "seasons" in which they gradually
metamorphose between appearing more sapling-like and more satyr/nymph-like, beginning and ending
the season in tree form. Their memories don't persist well between seasons so when they emerge,
a given dendrid might have a completely different personality.

Dendroi are found in most large forests and usually build their settlements near and around the
stumps of gargantuan "elder trees" leftover from a previous era.

### Dendrid Features

All Dendroi possess the following features:

> **Elemental Alignment - Wood**
>
> Increase Wood Alignment Power by 1.
>
> Elemental Alignment causes a variety of effects, see (TODO) for more info.
>
> <sub>As tree-folk, Dendroi are inseparable from a fundamental alignment to Elemental Wood.</sub>

> **Plant Biology**
>
> Only vulnerable to Poison and Diseases that affect plants.

> **Plant Medicine**
>
> Use **Husbandry** or **Nature** instead of **Medicine** to perform Medicine checks on Dendroi.

> **Aging Immunity**
>
> Effects that inflict aging do not harm Dendroi.
>
> <sub>Dendroi live for a very long time, rendering most aging effects a harmless drop in the
> bucket.</sub>

Dendroi also possess less-common abilities of Regeneration and Cloning which is not listed here.

### Dendrid Skills

**Choose 1**: Stealth, History, Medicine, Nature, Animism, Tracking, Performance

### Dendrid Traits

Optionally choose one of the following Traits:

> **Delicate** `CHA+1` `STR-1`
>
> <sub>Dendroi often exhibit a glamor of beauty and a tendency toward festivity befitting their
> Dryad and Satyr "parents". As saplings though, many dendroi have narrow limbs and musculature that
> are not especially suited to explosive power, preferring gentle and steady approach
> to things.</sub>

> **Flighty** `DEX+1` `INT-1`
>
> <sub>Dendroi can have incredibly steady and precise hands and usually are light-footed. Dendroi
> can hold very still in a meadow against a tree and become nearly invisible to all but the most
> keen observers. One would think these behaviors would lead to the Dendroi having much time to
> their thoughts, but Dendroi also have a tendency to think about absolutely nothing for days at a
> time much like a tree.</sub>

> **Wizened** `WIS+1` `CON-1`
>
> <sub>Dendroi live for a very long time and often have vague recollections of many past seasons
> giving them unique perspectives on things. Old as they can be though, Dendroi are still saplings
> of the great trees they will eventually become and are thus of light and narrow stature.</sub>

## Orid

The Oroi are humanoid clay-folk. As a rule, all Oroi are exactly 5' tall and weigh 140 pounds. This
is because they are made to exacting precision by the Craftsman, their god. Long ago, a group
of Oreades (Mountain Nymphs) desired to live in the mortal world and petitioned the Craftsman to
make bodies for them to inhabit. They also asked the Craftsman to make caretakers and assistants for
them. The Craftsman agreed and thus the Orid Queens and Oroi were born. Each time a volcano erupts,
the Craftsman is firing a great kiln to bake more Oroi who will eventually be unearthed by other
Oroi.

Oroi physically resemble painted ceramic urns in humanoid shape, with a broad variety of colors,
patterns, and even decorative features like tails and horns. Oroi Queens have similar features and
are 10' tall giants, but commonly shrink themselves down to 5'1", an inch higher than their Oroi
subjects.

Generally, Oroi live on and in hills and mountains in highly organized and industrious guild-based
societies.

### Orid Features

All Oroi possess the following features:

> **Elemental Alignment - Earth**
>
> Increase Earth Alignment Power by 1.
>
> Elemental Alignment causes a variety of effects, see (TODO) for more info.
>
> <sub>Created from the Living Clay, Oroi are inseparably aligned with Elemental Earth</sub>

> **Artificial Biology**
>
> Only vulnerable to Poison and Diseases that affect constructs.

> **Artificial Medicine**
>
> Use **Appraisal** instead of **Medicine** to perform Medicine checks on Oroi.

> **Asphyxiation Resistance**
>
> Asphyxiation damage reduced by half and cannot die as a result of asphyxiation, falling
> unconscious instead.

> **Sinks in Water**
>
> Automatically fail all Swimming checks, sinking to the bottom of any body of water.

### Orid Skills

**Choose 1**: Locks and Traps, Stealth, Appraisal, History, Literacy, Tactics, Perception

### Orid Traits

Optionally choose one of the following Traits:

> **Dense** `CON+1` `INT-1`
>
> <sub>Some Oroi are made with very thick skin, leaving less room in the head for sophisticated
> thoughts.</sub>

> **Fixated** `DEX+1` `WIS-1`
>
> <sub>Many Oroi are incredibly handy, befitting a group created the Craftsman. Some Oroi are so
> hyper-focused on their craft at the detriment to their situational awareness.</sub>

> **Headstrong** `STR+1` `CHA-1`
>
> <sub>Oroi are strong and hardworking, taking on physically arduous trades. They also have a
> tendency to mannerisms that might seem strange to non-oroi, or even oroi outside their
> own clan.</sub>

# Classes

> **Character Creation Step 3 - Select a Class**
>
> Select a class for your character. The possible classes are [Fighter](#fighter),
> [Ranger](#ranger), [Knight](#knight), [Rogue](#rogue), [Scout](#scout), [Seeker](#seeker),
> [Adept](#adept), [Cleric](#cleric), and [Magician](#magician). Based on your selection:
> 1. Copy down your class' **Initial Hit Points** and **Hit Dice**.
> 2. Note any **Features** your class provides at Level 1.
> 3. Choose a number of **Skills** determined by your class.


Your character's class heavily influences the role they will play in the party. Each Class is
composed of a Primary Class Type and Secondary Class Type. There are three possible Class Types,
resulting in nine possible Classes.

The Class' Primary Class Type defines the main role the class fills and Secondary Class Type
adds variation. The three Class Types are:

- **Fighters**: combatants who attack multiple times per round and specialize in fighting styles
- **Rogues**: skill generalists who handle a broad variety of common adventuring problems
- **Adepts**: spell casters who use magic to support allies and destroy enemies
